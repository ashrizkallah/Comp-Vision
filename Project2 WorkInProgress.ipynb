    "# Graded Assignment 2: Building a Face Recognition System with DeepFace\n",
    "\n",
    "In the digital era, face recognition systems are widely used in various applications, including security systems and social media platforms. The ability to accurately identify and authenticate individuals is crucial for enhancing safety and improving user experiences. In this graded assignment, you will build a reliable face verification and recognition system using DeepFace, a powerful library that simplifies facial recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepFace leverages several advanced models, including FaceNet and VGG-Face, to generate face embeddings, which are compact and discriminative feature representations of faces. These embeddings are unique to each individual, making it easier to compare and identify faces. In this assignment, you will practice building a face verification system to confirm a person's identity and a face recognition system to identify and label individuals from a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a Face Recognition System: Create a face recognition system capable of identifying a person from a given set of faces. This will include matching the embeddings of an unknown face to a database of known embeddings and identifying the most similar one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare Models: Compare the performance of different models in face recognition and verification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluation and Performance Analysis: Assess your findings to identify the advantages and disadvantages of your implementation.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Imports: The function imports the DeepFace class from the DeepFace library, which provides tools for face recognition and verification.\n",

    "- Function Definition: face_verification(image_path1, image_path2, model_name='VGG-Face', distance_metric='cosine') accepts two image paths as inputs along with optional parameters for the model name and distance metric. By default, it uses the 'VGG-Face' model and the 'cosine' distance metric.\n",
